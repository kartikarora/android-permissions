For too long I used to wander the streets of wild permissions just to check if that one permission required for my Android App is dangerous or not!

Well, **NOT ANYMORE**

## Android Permissions

Consolidated list of 138 Android Permissions, with:
- Name
- Description
- Constant
- API Level
- Deprecated Status
- Dangerous Status

Go [here](https://android-permissions.herokuapp.com) to see it in action

[**It has an API too!** Yayee](https://android-permissions.herokuapp.com/api)

Oh yes, if you want to, please contribute! Runs on Flask and uses JSON and a little bit of Jinja2
